# Quality Camera üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team Pheonix


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Albin Jose Mathew - Mar Baselios Christian College Of Engineering
- Member 2: Abin George Varughese - Mar Baselios Christian College Of Engineering


### Project Description
Quality Camera is a purposely useless invention.
It only works when the air conditions are ‚Äújust right.‚Äù
If the atmosphere isn't suitable, it refuses to take pictures.
There‚Äôs no clear logic ‚Äî just pure absurdity.
The camera checks imaginary air standards before working.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where cameras work too reliably, there‚Äôs a serious lack of devices that value atmospheric vibes over practicality. People are taking photos anytime, anywhere ‚Äî without considering the "quality" of the air around them. This chaotic freedom leads to excessive documentation without regard for the air‚Äôs mood, freshness, or invisible standards. Clearly, what we need is a camera that says, ‚ÄúNot today.‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To address the "urgent" issue of cameras being too available, we created the Air-Qualified Camera ‚Äî a device that refuses to take pictures unless the air meets its arbitrary standards. It adds drama, suspense, and a touch of ego to photography. No more boring, effortless clicks ‚Äî this camera makes you earn your photo. Because sometimes, doing less... feels like¬†doing¬†more
